## VSCodeWinContextHelper.reg
Platform:
Win

Description:
These Windows Registry entries will add menu items to your context menus that will allow you to right on or within a folder and open it as a VSCode Workspace without VSCode having to first be opened.

This is very usefull if you recently clone a GitHub repo outside of VSCode and want to quickly get started.

Notes:
This will allow to open any folder as a VSCode Worspace but does not save the worspace file automatically. So after opening the workspace, it is best practice to save the workspace file after opening if you intend to work on the workspace again. How ever if you do not, you can always right-click and use the shortcut again.
